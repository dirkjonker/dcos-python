Python libraries for DC/OS

This is forked off https://github.com/dcos/dcos-cli

Main goal is to provide a library for automating operations on DC/OS, with Ansible as
the target application that will use this library.

See also: https://github.com/dirkjonker/ansible-dcos for action plugins to control DC/OS using Ansible playbooks.
